Final Project for the Digital Audio Engineering MSc - A Physical Modelling Synthesiser of a Guitar

ABSTRACT
Real world sounds often contain complex frequency components and have proved difficult to reproduce using standard methods of synthesis such as FM, additive, and subtractive. Physical modelling synthesis emulates real world sounds by mathematically modelling the properties of the sound source. It is complex and differs depending on what instrument/sound is modelled and is considered to have potential for further refinement. This report documents the design and implementation of a physical modelling synthesizer plugin modelling a guitar; controlled using MIDI 1.0 and with further research and recommendations for upgrading the control system to make use of MIDI 2.0â€™s advancements.
